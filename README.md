# Discordia
[Discordia] is a community-made wiki about [Discord].

From [Easter Eggs] to [User Settings] we cover (almost) any information you may want to know about Discord.

## Wanna help?
Great! We appreciate any help to expand and improve the wiki.  
You can contribute to our project in a few ways.

### Markdown Editor
We use [Wiki.js v2] for rendering and handling the wiki pages on our side and recommend you to use their Markdown Editor for editing and creating pages.  
Please take a look at their [User Guide][guide] to get a basic understanding of what the editor may offer.

### Pull Request
You can also create a Pull request here on GitHub to update and/or add pages of the wiki.  
Please make sure that your PR targets the `new` branch, as it is the main one used by the wiki itself.

## Questions?
If you have any questions about us or the wiki, don't hesitate to join our [Discord Server][server] for help.
