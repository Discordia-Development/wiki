Discord allows users with Nitro to *boost* a Discord Server, which can unlock various perks for the entire server.

# Getting Boosts
You can purchase boosts in two ways:
- If you subscribe to/are gifted [Nitro](/nitro), you get 2 free Boosts and a discount on separately purchased Boosts.
- You can also pay for Boosts separately from Nitro.

If you have Nitro Classic, you won't get any free boosts but you will get the discount.

# Boost levels
Depending on how many Boosts a server has, it unlocks new levels.

## Level 1
Can be unlocked with 2 boosts, meaning that a single Nitro user could unlock it.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 50 additional Slots for both animated and normal Emotes (100 normal and 100 animated in total)
- 128 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat (Compared to the normal 96 Kbps)
- Option to set an animated Server icon
- Option to set a custom background for the Invite screen
- 720p 60fps Go Live Streaming

## Level 2
Can be unlocked with 15 boosts.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 50 additional Slots for animated and normal emotes (150 normal and 150 animated in total)
- 256 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat
- Option to set a server banner (Visible at the top of the channel selection)
- 50MB upload limit for all Members on the Discord
- 1080p 60fps Go Live Streaming

## Level 3
Can be unlocked with 30 boosts and is the highest level a Discord can reach.

This level unlocks the following perks:
- 100 additional Slots for animated and normal emotes (250 normal and 250 animated in total)
- 384 Kbps Audio quality for voice chat
- Option to set a vanity URL (discord.gg/yourVanityUrl)
- 100MB upload limit for all Members on the Discord

# Your benefits
By boosting a Server will you receive some benefits.

- A pink ruby will be displayed right next to your name in the member list of the Server(s) you boost.
- You'll get a dedicated booster role for the Server(s) you're boosting.
- Your profile will display a [Badge](/badges#server-boosting) if you boost at least one server for a certain period.

## Badges <img src="/uploads/badges/boosting_icons.png" alt="Server boosting" height="19">
Depending on how long you've been boosting at least one server, your profile will have one of the following badges:
![boosting_progress.png](/uploads/badges/boosting_progress.png 'All the boost badges and how long you need to boost to get them.')
> Note that if you don't renew you Boost/Nitro subscription, your badge will be reset.

# Losing boosts
The server will lose boosts when a server booster either moves their Boost(s) to another server, or their Nitro/Boost subscription expires.
Servers have a "grace period" of 3 days before they actually lose the level in case the booster forgot to renew their subscription or similar.
