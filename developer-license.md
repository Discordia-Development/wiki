Discord's Developer Application License (commonly known as the <strong>gamedev license</strong>) is a license that you need to buy if you want to publish your game on Discord.

On the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) you will see a prompt talking about the license on the left bottom corner. _Your app should be on a team to get a license._

Purchasing this license will give you the ability to create announcement channels (although you can also make them in community servers), store channels and a store page along with giving you the ability to make your server public and server analytics.

# News Channels

News Channels are like the announcement channels you make on your server these ones can be followed by users, the following system is like using a webhook but without hassling with anything but just clicking a button. A news channel may look like this.

# Store Channels

Store Channels are channels you can see game details at, they're similar to store pages but they're contained inside your server on a channel, these channels have a naming structure similar to voice channels which allows uppercase characters and spaces in their names. A store channel may look like this.
