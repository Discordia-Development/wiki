Discord has different badges that distinguish a user as a member of specific groups. Badges display on a user's profile card. To access someone's profile card, click them and select **view profile** by hovering over their avatar. 

Badges appear in a hierarchical order, and multiple badges will stack.

# General Badges
If a user has multiple badges, all badges that the user has will appear.

If you want to be randomly assigned to a house, use the last option for all questions.
