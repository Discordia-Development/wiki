# Discord Server Limits
This page lists the various "limitations" imposed upon servers in Discord, mostly to answer "how many X can I make?" questions. It's important to note that other than the 5,000 online user limit, **none of these can be modified**. There is currently no feature/method by which a server or user can bypass the limitations noted below.

- A user cannot be on more than **100 servers**. Once this limit is hit, any server invite will display as "Invite Expired".
- Normally servers have a member limit of **250,000** members. However, some partnered and verified servers can get this limit raised to **500,000**.
- Servers reaching **25,000** *simultaneous online* members will need to contact Support to be moved to hardware supporting larger servers - this is when members start getting "Server Unavailable" errors.
- A server can have *at most* **500 channels** - text, voice, and categories combined. Once 500 channels are reached, no more channels can be created.
- A category can have *at most* **50 channels** - text and voice combined. Once 50 channels are reached, no more channels can be created inside that category.
- A server can have *at most* **250 roles**. 
- Servers reaching **1,000** members have the offline members list removed.

## Emoji Limits
The amount of emojis (Both normal and animated ones) a Server can have can change with the current boost level of the server.

- No boosts (No level): **50 regular and 50 animated emojis**
- 2 boosts (Level 1): **100 regular and 100 animated emojis**
